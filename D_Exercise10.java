/*
It is said that an element in array is alone if there are values before and after it, and those values are different from it.
Write a function that accepts an array and a number and prints the given array where every instance of the given value
which is alone is replaced by whichever value to its left or right is larger.
Sample Output:
notAlone([1, 2, 3], 2) → [1, 3, 3]
notAlone([1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2], 2) → [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 2]
notAlone([3, 4], 3) → [3, 4]
